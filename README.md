A shape memorization game! Select the correct sequence of shapes highlighted and if you lose you have a chance of revival through a game of rock paper scissors! This is a memorization game that displays 4 shapes; circles, square, triangle and rectangle. One of the shapes is highlighted to indicate that the shape must be selected. If the correct highlighted shape is selected then the server highlights the same shape and highlights one more additional shape. Indicating that the user must select the two shapes in the correct order. This cycle continues while highlighting one extra shape each time, until the wrong shape or order of shapes is selected. If the wrong shape is selected the user has the option to play a rock paper scissors game that if they win will allow them to start where they left off. If not the game starts over from round 1.
